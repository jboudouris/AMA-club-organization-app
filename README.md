AMA Club App
Requirements and Specification Document
2019-02-09, version 1.0

# Project Abstract - Logan
Running a student organization is a complicated process. From struggling with the logistics of setting up events to handling administrative tasks like tracking member involvement, the process of running a student organization in today's world requires several apps to manage. In the present day, apps like Slack, Google Calendars, Google Docs, and Doodle Polls would be used to handle all these day-to-day problems. The goal of the AMA Club Organization App is to streamline all these processes and centralize their use within a single app. The key features of this application will be a calendar where members can view upcoming events and RSVP to them, a profile page where members can see their standing, a social panel with access to a member list and chatrooms, and a club info page where important documents and notifications will be posted. The system will be a mobile application in which all members of the club would use and will improve the functionality of the organization as a whole.

## Document Revision History
Rev. 1.0 <YYYY-MM-DD>: initial version

## Customer
The Customer for the AMA club organization app is the AMA organization on campus. Specifically, we are communicating with the Vice President of the club. She will be able to test the app along with other members of their executive board and selected club members throughout the development process. 

She is the direct contact for creating the applications specifications, meeting with our development group to discuss what features they would like to see. She has helped organize which features are priority and would have the biggest impact to her clubs efficiency and how they would impact the club. She has also expressed desire for certain features which would be useful but not entirely required to have a functioning application. She is able to check in with her club for further ideas which emerge over the semester and provide immediate feedback on the project as needed. We will continue to meet with her whenever we have questions or features for her to test, or when she has a new request or feedback for us.

## Competitive Landscape
Briefly identify the competitors in this market. This may need to be on a country and industry basis as the landscape varies dramatically. Any functional details about the competitive solutions should be provided. For example the known strengths or differentiating points in the competitive solutions, and also their weakness. Identifying the strengths helps ensure that we design a competitive solution; the weaknesses allow us to consider these as areas for potential differentiation. Remember there are all sorts of sources for competitive information — marketing, development, customers, the Internet, field staff, and those that we have hired from the competition — so don’t be afraid to be creative here. Note that this section may or may not be something that we want customers to see, depending on how ‘honest’ of a company as which we wish to appear. What product features can create competitive differentiators? Competitive barriers? Can a patent position be obtained in this area? What is the current patent status in this arena?

## User Requirements
This section lists the behavior that the users see. This information needs to be presented in a logical, organized fashion. It is most helpful if this section is organized in outline form: a bullet list of major topics (e.g., one for each kind of user, or each major piece of system functionality) each with some number of subtopics.

## Use Cases
Use cases that support the user requirements in the previous section. Every major scenario should be represented by a use case, and every use case should say something not already illustrated by the other use cases. Diagrams (such as sequence charts) are encouraged. Ask the customer what are the most important use cases to implement by the deadline. You can have a total ordering, or mark use cases with “must have,” “useful,” or “optional.” For each use case you may list one or more concrete acceptance tests (concrete scenarios that the customer will try to see if the use case is implemented).

## User Interface Requirements- Jake
Describes any customer user interface requirements including graphical user interface requirements as well as data exchange format requirements. This also should include necessary reporting and other forms of human readable input and output. This should focus on how the feature or product and user interact to create the desired workflow. Describing your intended interface as “easy” or “intuitive” will get you nowhere unless it is accompanied by details.

## Security Requirements
Discuss what security requirements are necessary and why. Are there privacy or confidentiality issues? Is your system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks?

## System Requirements
List here all of the external entities, other than users, on which your system will depend. For example, if your system inter-operates with sendmail, or if you will depend on Apache for the web server, or if you must target both Unix and Windows, list those requirements here. List also memory requirements, performance/speed requirements, data capacity requirements, if applicable.

## Specification- Jake
A detailed specification of the system. Every possible execution should be in the specification, though not every aspect need be covered in extraordinary depth. UML, or other diagrams, such as finite automata, or other appropriate specification formalisms, are encouraged over natural language.
